## Description

This website has been a victim of "dirty code" things like having elements in places where its unreadable and hard to understand what the part of the code does. or even the website being unaccsesible to people with disabilities. im refactoring the code in order to make sure that its up to standards when it comes to website standards, and that elements are being used correctly and not confusing the program casuing it to load up the website slower.

## Code Refactoring Example


```html
<div class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<header>
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </header>
```
Converting the (div) to the semantic element of header because the header element can hold sets of navigational links while division elements cant do it as well.  
```html
<div class="content">
        <div class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>
        </div>
 ----------------------------------------------------
 <div class="content">
        <div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>
        </div>       
```
updating this code because on the website users are not getting redirected where they are suppose to by clicking the search engine optimization header. it needed a id along with the class in order for it to work.
```html
<div class="content">
        <div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>

This block of code had no alternate attributes for people who have disabilities. i added them so it makes the site more accesible to everyone.
